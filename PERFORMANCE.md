| mixed operations | 58,661 | 61,471 | +4.8% |

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. WeakMap Operation Optimization
- Reduced WeakMap access overhead by caching initialization state
- Eliminated redundant `$WeakMap` checks on every operation

### 2. Reference Tracking Cache
- Added `wmInitialized` and `mInitialized` boolean flags
- Eliminated repeated `if ($wm)` checks after initialization

### 3. Has/Get Operation Fast-Path
- Early return optimization for common case (initialized WeakMap + object key)
- Reduced branching for hot path operations

### 4. GC-Friendly Caching
- Uses boolean flags instead of additional WeakMap lookups
- No additional memory overhead for tracking state

### 5. Entry Access Optimization
- Cached type checking with `isObjectOrFunction` function
- Single `typeof` operation per call instead of inline checks

## Performance Highlights

- **Best improvement**: `get (missing)` operations are **95.5% faster**
- **Second best**: `has (missing)` operations are **85.3% faster**
- **Consistent gains**: All operations show improvement
- **Average improvement**: ~34.9% across all operations

## Implementation Details

The optimizations maintain full backward compatibility and pass all existing tests with 100% of tests passing (24/24).

### Code Changes
- Added `isObjectOrFunction` helper function to reduce duplicate type checks
- Added `wmInitialized` and `mInitialized` state tracking
- Optimized control flow for fast-path operations
- Eliminated redundant null/undefined checks

### Test Results
```
# tests 24
# pass  24
# ok

Code Coverage:
Statements   : 87.04% ( 47/54 )
Branches     : 73.33% ( 33/45 )
Functions    : 100% ( 7/7 )
Lines        : 87.04% ( 47/54 )
```

All optimizations are production-ready and maintain the same API surface.
